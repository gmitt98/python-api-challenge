## bootcamp module 6 challenge



### Note:
The WeatherPy notebook used the citipy module. However, I had difficulty with this module and also wanted additional features that it did not have.
I copied it and made a citipy2 module that is in the main project folder. My notebook uses this module instead.
I also copied the unit testing file for the original module and updated it to demonstrate that this works.
The module is documented and there is a longer explanation in the note for my notebook code.
